## Installation

Clone the repository, `cd` into the directory and run `yarn` (or `npm install`) on your command line to install all the dependencies. You're ready to go now !

## Usage

There are npm scripts for all the relevant things. The server will always be started on port 8500 unless otherwise specified in process.env.PORT. You can use a .env file to specify env vars. If you want to use them in your client side code, don't forget to add them in config/env.ts.

#### `yarn start`

Starts the app in development mode: creates a new client and server dev build using [Webpack][webpack-url], starts the [Express][express-url] server build (for both file serving and server side pre-rendering) and keeps webpack open in watchmode. Updates the app (if possible) on change using HMR.

#### `yarn build`

Creates a new build optimized for production.
